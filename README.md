# Orderly SDK
Orderly SDK is a complete library to interact with Orderly contracts and rest api. You can use it in the browser. Orderly contracts are built on NEAR network.

## Typescript
Library is written fully in Typescript, so no additional types installation is needed.

## Usage

### Available clients
1. `contractsApi` - asset manager smart contract client;
2. `ftClient` - fungible token smart contract client;
3. `restApi` - REST API client.
4. `wsPublic` - Publis WebSocket. Wallet connection not required.
5. `wsPrivate` - Private WebSocket. Wallet connection required.

### Initialization
To initialize these clients you will need:
1. For asset manager contract client - SDK configration options;
2. For fungible token contract client - contract URL and SDK configration options;
3. For REST client - SDK configration options;

SDK configuration options is an object with the next properties:
1. `networkId` - NEAR network id to which we want to connect when we are working with the SDK. Currently Orderly contracts are deployed to `testnet` and `mainnet` (fungible token contract is deployed only to `testnet`).

> **_Note:_**
> You can read about NEAR CLI [here](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli)

Also, for smart contract clients, if you want to change the NEAR configuration options, pass them as the last parameter in their constructors.


### First steps
After instantiating the smart contract client, call the `connect` function.

```js
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet'
});

// you can bind that to connection button
await authClient.connect()

const api = await authClient.restApi()
const contract = await authClient.contractsApi();
const ft = await authClient.ftClient();


```

Also you can use public API as well without connection.

```js
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
  debug: true
});

const pubClient = authClient.publicClient();
await pubClient.getAvailableSymbols()

```
To avoid version conflicts of `near-js-api` you can import it from SDK.

```js
import { AuthClient } from 'orderly-sdk';

const authClient = new AuthClient({
  networkId: 'testnet',
  contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
  debug: true
});

const nearApi = authClient.nearJsApi
```

### Public WebSocket
Note: When user not connected you can use public key for wsPublic 
`bf6eb263984c964a0cda3e9a35aa486268eea085d9b90fe792c8f9ad7e129a2c`

```js
    const [wsClientPublic, setWsClientPublic] = useState(null);

    const initPublicWs = () => {
      const authClient = new AuthClient({
        networkId: 'testnet',
        contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
        debug: true
      });

      const publicKeyOrWalletID = 'bf6eb263984c964a0cda3e9a35aa486268eea085d9b90fe792c8f9ad7e129a2c'

      const wsPublic = authClient.wsClientPublic('testnet', publicKeyOrWalletID);
      wsPublic.connect();
      setWsClientPublic(wsPublic)
    }

    const subscribe = () => {
      const subscription = { id: 'client_id1', event: 'subscribe', topic: 'SPOT_WOO_USDC@trade' };
      wsClientPublic.sendSubscription(subscription);
    }

    const setPublicWsCallback = () => {
      wsClientPublic.setMessageCallback((message) => {
        // Process the received message
        console.log('Received data:', message);
      });
    }
```

### Private WebSocket
Required wallet connection

```js
    const [wsClientPrivate, setWsClientPrivate] = useState(null);

    const initPrivateWs = async () => {
      const authClient = new AuthClient({
        networkId: 'testnet',
        contractId: 'asset-manager.orderly.testnet',
        debug: true
      });

      const wsPrivate = await authClient.wsClientPrivate();
      await wsPrivate.connectPrivate();
      setWsClientPrivate(wsPrivate);
    }

    const subscribePrivate = () => {
      const subscription = {
        "id": "123r",
        "topic": "balance",
        "event": "subscribe"
      }
      wsClientPrivate.sendPrivateSubscription(subscription);
    }

    const setPublicWsCallback = () => {
      wsClientPrivate.setPrivateMessageCallback((message) => {
        // Process the received message
        console.log('Received data:', message);
      });
    }
```
